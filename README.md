# McDonald's Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Abstract
This study analyzes McDonald's customer satisfaction using machine learning approaches. We investigate what influences satisfaction based on internet reviews using sentiment analysis and predictive modeling. Feature extraction and text normalization are two examples of initial data preprocessing. While sentiment analysis provides information about the attitudes of customers, predictive modeling finds salient features like store specifics and time-related elements. Model effectiveness is validated using performance evaluation criteria such as accuracy, F1 score, and MSE. To improve predictive skills, more ML algorithms and sensitivity analysis are taken into consideration throughout further exploration.

## **Project Workflow**

#### 1. Data Collection:
Collected online reviews of McDonald's from various sources.

#### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, standardized text data, and removed unnecessary columns.

#### 3.Feature Engineering:
Extracted relevant features, including deriving city and state from store addresses and creating new columns for star ratings.

#### 4. Summary Statistics:
Provided numerical summaries and analyzed categorical and temporal variables.

#### 5. Visualizations:
Conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to visualize data patterns.

#### 6. Sentiment Analysis:
Applied NLP techniques to extract sentiment scores and identify keywords.

#### 7. Statistical Analysis:
Conducted correlation analysis and explored differences in ratings based on various factors.

#### 8. Predictive Modeling:
Built and evaluated a machine learning model to predict customer sentiment.

#### 9. Performance Metrics Evaluation:
Validated model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and MSE.

#### 10. Conclusion:
Summarized findings and discussed the efficacy of machine learning techniques in analyzing customer satisfaction.
